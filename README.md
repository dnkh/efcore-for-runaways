# EF Core for Runaways

This repository contains a collection of demos demonstrating Entity Framework Core concepts and performance optimizations.

Each demo resides in its own folder at the repository root and is numbered in increments of 10. The first demo, `10-initial-project`, provides the baseline application on which later demos build.

It is possible to run the demos in a github codespace
You need to install the "ef core tools" and the VsCode Extension "SQLite Viewer

If there is time left I will add a ".DevContainer" file for the initial setup
